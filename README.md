# Kidney_Stones_Classification

## Description
This is a personal project in which I build a CI/CD pipeline for a health classification problem.
The goal is to predict whether a patient has kidney stones or not based on their urine analysis results.

I build this project to practice my skills in data science, machine learning, data engineering and MLOps 💪.
The project aims to use several tool such as Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, FastAPI, Streamlit, Docker, DVC, MLEM, AWS S3/EC2 and GitHub Actions.
