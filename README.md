# Kidney_Stones_Classification

## Description
This is a personal project in which I build a CI/CD pipeline for a health classification problem. The goal is to predict whether a patient has kidney stones or not based on their urine analysis results.
I built this project to practice my skills in data science, machine learning, and MLOps.
The project aims to practice with the use of several tool such as Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, FastAPI, Streamlit, Docker, DVC, MLEM, AWS EC2 and GitHub Actions.
